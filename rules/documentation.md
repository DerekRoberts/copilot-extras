# Documentation Rules

## Privacy in Documentation

**When creating or editing documentation (README.md, etc.):**
- **NEVER include personal names** - use generic placeholders like "YOUR_USERNAME" or "user"
- **NEVER include specific folder structures** - use generic paths like `~/workspace` rather than specific directory names
- **NEVER include personal identifiers** - keep examples generic and applicable to anyone
- Use placeholders (`YOUR_USERNAME`, `~/workspace`, etc.) that users can replace with their own values
